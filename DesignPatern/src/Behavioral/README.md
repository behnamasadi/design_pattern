## Observer
Defines a a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object state changes, 
all of its dependencies are noified and updated automatically

## Iterator
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).



## Mediator
As to overcome the limitation of the Observer Design Pattern which works in a one-to-many relationship, Mediator Design Pattern can be employed for a many-to-many relationship.
