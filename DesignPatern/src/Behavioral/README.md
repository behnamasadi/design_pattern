## Chain Of Responsibility
## Command
## Interpreter
## Iterator
Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
## Mediator
As to overcome the limitation of the Observer Design Pattern which works in a one-to-many relationship, Mediator Design Pattern can be employed for a many-to-many relationship.
## Memento
## NullObject
## Observer
Defines a a one to many dependency between objects so that when one object state changes, 
all of its dependencies are noified and updated automatically
## State
## Strategy
## Template Method
## Visitor
