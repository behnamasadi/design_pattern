## Component Diagram

Node=Component
Component set fo classes with a well-defined interface


Edge=Relationship


can be used to represent an architecture

Components are connected through implemented and required interfaces, often using the ball-andsocket notation (page 71) just as for class diagrams. You can also decompose components by using
composite structure diagrams.


A component is similar to a black box whose external behavior is defined by a provided interface and required interfaces.
